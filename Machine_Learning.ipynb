    "### üåü Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows systems to **learn from data**, **identify patterns**, and **make decisions** with minimal human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of being explicitly programmed with rules, an ML model learns to perform tasks by analyzing large amounts of **input data** and improving its accuracy over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìö Real-Life Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Spam detection** in Gmail\n",
    "* **Recommendation systems** on Netflix and Amazon\n",
    "* **Self-driving cars**\n",

    "* **Goal**: Improve learning efficiency when labeling data is expensive.\n",
    "* **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Web page classification with few tagged samples\n",
    "* **Approach**: Combines supervised + unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Reinforcement Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition**: An agent learns to take actions in an environment to **maximize rewards**.\n",
    "* **Goal**: Learn by trial-and-error with feedback in the form of rewards.\n",
